    st.markdown("""
        ### Proportion Estimation:
        Use this when you're trying to estimate a single proportion‚Äîlike what percentage of people in a city have diabetes or how many support a health policy. It‚Äôs perfect for cross-sectional surveys or baseline assessments where your goal is just to understand ‚Äúhow much‚Äù or ‚Äúhow many.‚Äù
        
        ### Normal Mean Estimation:
        Go for this when you're estimating an average‚Äîsay, the average systolic blood pressure in a population. This works best if your outcome is normally distributed. You‚Äôll commonly use this in clinical studies, nutrition research, or any setting where averages matter.
        
        ### Skewed Normal Mean Estimation:
        Not everything follows a normal curve. Think of healthcare costs or lengths of hospital stay‚Äîthese are usually skewed. If your variable is skewed but you still want to estimate a mean, use this method. It relies on the coefficient of variation (CV) instead of the standard deviation.
        
        ### Sensitivity & Specificity:
        This is for those working on diagnostic accuracy. If you‚Äôve built a new test or screening tool and want to validate its performance, this calculator helps you plan for estimating sensitivity and specificity with precision.
        
        ### Intraclass Correlation (ICC) Estimation:
        Use this in reliability studies. For example, if multiple raters are evaluating X-rays or you're checking how consistent measurements are within clusters, ICC tells you how much of the variability is due to real differences vs. measurement noise.
        
        ### ICC Hypothesis Testing:
        Similar to ICC estimation, but here you're testing a hypothesis‚Äîmaybe you want to prove that your new tool has better reliability than a certain threshold (e.g., ICC > 0.70). Great for multi-site reliability checks or instrument validation.
        
        ### Chen‚Äôs Kappa Estimation:
        Need to measure agreement between raters for categorical data? Kappa is your go-to. Use this when you're dealing with yes/no, present/absent kind of decisions‚Äîlike whether two doctors agree on a diagnosis. Works with 2 or more raters.
        
        ### Two Sample Normal Mean Hypothesis:
        You‚Äôll use this in classic setups like comparing treatment vs. control groups. Say you want to know if a new diet reduces blood sugar more than the standard one. If your outcome is continuous and your groups are independent, this is your choice.
        
        ### One Way ANOVA:
        Got three or more groups to compare? That‚Äôs where ANOVA comes in. Use this in multi-arm clinical trials, educational experiments, or policy evaluations where multiple interventions are being compared.
        
        ### Paired t-Test:
        Perfect for before-after studies. If you‚Äôre giving the same group a treatment and measuring the difference in some continuous outcome, this is your test. Think pre- and post-intervention blood pressure, or step count after using a fitness app.
        
        ### Two Sample Proportion Hypothesis Testing:
        Here, you‚Äôre comparing proportions‚Äîfor example, the percentage of smokers in two different cities or success rates of two drugs. If your outcome is binary and your groups are independent, this is the tool.
        
        ### Paired Proportion (McNemar Test):
        This is for comparing paired binary outcomes‚Äîthink of it like a paired t-test but for yes/no outcomes. Example: Did smoking status change before and after an awareness campaign within the same group?
        
        ### Two Sample Poisson Rate Comparison:
        If you‚Äôre comparing event rates (like infections per 1000 patient-days), and you expect count data over time or person-time, use this. Common in hospital-based studies or epidemiological surveillance.
        
        ### Correlation Test:
        Trying to understand if two continuous variables move together? Correlation is what you want. Like checking the relationship between BMI and cholesterol. This helps you figure out if a linear relationship exists and how strong it is.
        
        ### Case Control Design: 
        This is your tool for retrospective studies. You‚Äôve got cases and controls, and you're looking backward to see if exposure rates differ. It's especially useful in rare disease research, where measuring odds is more practical than risk.
        
        ### Cohort Design:
        Ideal for longitudinal studies. You follow two groups over time and compare risk or incidence rates. Use this when you're tracking outcomes like heart attacks, recovery, or vaccine breakthrough infections.
        
        ### Survival Analysis ‚Äì Log-Rank Test:
        When your outcome is time-to-event, this test is key. Say you're comparing how long patients survive under two treatments. Use this in oncology studies, clinical trials, or anywhere time plays a critical role.
        
        ### Linear Regression:
        This one‚Äôs for predictive modeling with continuous outcomes. Want to see how education, income, and age affect blood pressure? Use linear regression‚Äîit tells you how much change you can expect in the outcome for each predictor.
        
        ### Logistic Regression:
        When your outcome is binary‚Äîlike disease or no disease‚Äîlogistic regression helps you understand how different predictors influence the odds. Common in case-control and risk modeling studies.
        
        ### About:
        Think of this as your starting point. It gives you a quick tour of the app, how things are organized, and what each section is about.
        
        ### FAQ:
        Got doubts? Confused about what a dropdown means or why you‚Äôre being asked for alpha and beta? The FAQ section explains these, in plain language.
